# H-Hello-World
This is my first try doing this. I hope it works out.

Hello, I'm a comic book artist with two years of experience. I'm trying to learn coding so I can present a comic with serious complicated things in it... or it seems like it now... once I've learn about coding I believe it'll be less scary.
